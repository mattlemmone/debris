debris
===

A little project I tinkered around on back when I had first gotten my Chromecast. Learned quite a bit about promises.

Provides an API to upload magnet links / torrents to a real-debrid account, download them from the 'link generator', and stream directly to a Chromecast.

UnRAR.exe is used to automatically unzip any detected zip files.

An API token from real-debrid is necessary; be sure to export it from `server/api/token.js`.
